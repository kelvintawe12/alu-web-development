Overview
This project provides a basic HTML structure for a webpage layout, focusing solely on semantic HTML elements. The goal is to implement the fundamental structure without any styling or CSS, based on a given Figma design. The page includes a header, a main banner, membership options, an FAQ section, and a footer. This setup serves as the foundation for further development with CSS and JavaScript.

Features

Main Banner: Includes a heading, a brief introductory text, and a call-to-action button.
Features Section: Displays four feature blocks, each with an image, heading, and description.
Membership Section: Lists four membership options, each with an image, heading, description, and a join button.
FAQ Section: Provides answers to frequently asked questions, structured into two rows with two questions each.
Footer: Contains a logo, social media links, and a text description.
